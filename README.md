Startup application for BYU CS260

## Elevator Pitch:
    The overall idea would be a semi-competitive business simulator. Users would be able to make choices for their business that would affect 
  the chances of various random events that could affect their business. Over time, they would gain simulated money, which would appear on the 
  online scoreboard, to compare against different users. The site would have three simple HTML pages, one for login, one for the user's 
  individual business, and one for the scoreboard. CSS would insure that the layout does not appear crowded. Additionally good events would show 
  up in green, and bad events would show up in red, allowing users to get a general feel for the system.
