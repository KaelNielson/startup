# startup - Business Simulator
Startup application for BYU CS260

## Elevator Pitch:
    Everbody loves simulators. No matter what they simulate, people love to play and experiment with something they don't have the time to in 
  real life. One of the things that many people are interested in but for whatever reason do not pursue is running their own business. My 
  application would allow one to experience some of the joys and trials of trying to run a business, while random events continually 
  complicate it.
