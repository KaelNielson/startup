Startup application for BYU CS260

## Elevator Pitch:
    The overall idea would be a semi-competitive business simulator. Users would be able to make choices for their business that would affect 
  the chances of various random events that could affect their business. Over time, they would gain simulated money, which would appear on the 
  online scoreboard, to compare against different users. The random events, as well as player data, would be maintained in the backend. The site 
  would have three simple HTML pages, one for login, one for the user's individual business, and one for the scoreboard. CSS would insure that 
  the layout does not appear crowded. Additionally good events would show up in green, and bad events would show up in red, allowing users to get 
  a general feel for the system. Users would be given control over much of their business, including its name. However, they would be given the 
  option to generate a random business name using the Wordnik API.
